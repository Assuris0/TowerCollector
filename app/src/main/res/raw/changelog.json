I made this decision to accelerate development of new features by reducing waiting for translation time to minimum. In the future I will add a glossary and more detailed introduction for novice users in their native language. I'd like to thank all of you who were engaged in app translation over the years and dedicated their own time to Tower Collector. I really appreciate that, thanks!",
